# Implementation-of-Soft-Actor-Critic-algorithm
This is an implementation of the SAC reinforcement-learning algorithm introduced by Tuomas Haarnoja et. al.: Soft Actor-Critic: Off-Policy Maximum Entropy Deep Reinforcement Learning with a Stochastic Actor (2018). The SAC algorithm is used to train a model on the OpenAI Gym.
